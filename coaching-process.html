    <h1>The Coaching Process</h1>
    <p>Coaching is a partnership. My job is to help you figure out how to work with your brain, your values, and your environment to move you toward your goals. Together we will:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Identify strengths and challenges</li>
      <li>Clarify goals and expectations</li>
      <li>Build awareness of current patterns</li>
      <li>Experiment with new strategies</li>
      <li>Practice reflection and accountability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Coaching is not therapy, tutoring, or consulting. I won’t give you the answers or tell you what to do — instead, I’ll support you in developing the awareness, strategies, and tools that work for you.</p>

    <p>We can meet weekly or every other week depending on your goals and schedule. Sessions are typically 45 minutes and held over Zoom. Between sessions, I’ll support you with notes, tools, and accountability reminders as needed.</p>
