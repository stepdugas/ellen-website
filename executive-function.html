    <h1>ADHD & Executive Function Coaching</h1>
    <p>Executive function coaching is a type of coaching that addresses a set of cognitive skills known as executive functions, which are essential for managing thoughts, actions, and emotions to achieve goals. It is a practical, forward-thinking approach using concrete and actionable strategies to work with how your brain works. ADHD is the most common reason people seek this kind of coaching, but those without an ADHD diagnosis can also have difficulty with executive function skills.</p>

    <p>In executive function coaching, we work on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Planning and goal setting</li>
      <li>Prioritization</li>
      <li>Organization</li>
      <li>Time management</li>
      <li>Task initiation</li>
      <li>Accountability</li>
      <li>Implementing habits</li>
      <li>Work with your innate creative problem-solving abilities</li>
      <li>And really anything else that comes up that would be helpful to the individual</li>
    </ul>
