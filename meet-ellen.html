            <h2 id="background" class="section-heading heading-green">Background</h2>
            <p>Ellen graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.A. in Communications and minors in Art and Art History. She also obtained her Elementary Education teaching credentials certifications in California, and taught 1st, 2nd and 5th grades for 3 years. She is an Executive Function and Career Coach, with certifications from the International Coaching Federation and the Center for Executive Coaching.</p>

            <p>Her background most recently has been as an Executive Function Coach and Coordinator, and as a Career Coach at a technology bootcamp, where she has taught a diverse group of learners, aged 18–60, one on one, in groups, virtually, and in person. She has worked with many individuals with executive function challenges to help them achieve their goals in a fast-paced learning environment and find a rewarding tech position during career transitions. Ellen looks for the unique set of skills and learning style in each person, coaches time management and focus techniques, and uses creativity and positivity to build sustainable habits and confidence.</p>

            <p>Prior to that career, Ellen worked for CBS as the Casting Department Manager for Survivor and The Amazing Race, where she implemented organizational systems, managed complex projects, and interviewed thousands of people from all walks of life.</p>

            <p>In her free time, Ellen hangs out with her family and dogs, loves to see live music, draw, and travel to the beach.</p>

            <h2 id="approach" class="section-heading heading-green">Approach</h2>
            <p>I support and mentor with a focus on kindness, positivity and accountability. We begin by getting to know each other, so that I can start to create a plan that will work for you as an individual. Each person comes to coaching with their own experiences, their own strengths. First I listen; then, I flex my expertise in organization and communication to reach positive outcomes with clients, as they build habits using learning tools I often create individually. The goal is to engrain the habits, increase confidence in yourself, and eventually you will not need me any more.</p>

            <h2 id="why" class="section-heading heading-green">Why I Love What I Do</h2>
            <p>You have a superpower, but maybe you don’t know it yet! Your unique way of thinking may have caused you frustration as you try to work within a certain learning style that doesn’t work for you. How does your brain learn and organize? How can we take your outside the box, creative thinking and embrace that, while supporting a system that works for you? There is nothing more satisfying than helping someone make progress with their individual goals. This has been a theme in my work for 20+ years.</p>

            <h2 id="contact" class="section-heading heading-green">Contact</h2>
