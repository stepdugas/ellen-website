          I have had the privilege of working closely with Ellen in her role as a Pathway Program Director at Tech Elevator, and I am consistently impressed by her exceptional contributions to our coding bootcamp. With over two decades of experience, Ellen brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to her role. Her deep understanding of the unique needs and challenges faced by both learners and employers in this competitive field is invaluable.
          <br><br>
          She has a genuine passion for understanding what motivates individuals and helping them achieve their aspirations. Having seen Ellen in action, I can attest to her remarkable talent for listening and providing targeted guidance, which leads to the success of our students. Her mission to empower individuals with the necessary skills, confidence, and connections for thriving in the technology industry is both admirable and impactful.

          From our first interaction, I perceived Ellen's professionalism and expertise. …. This kind of dedication to subject matter knowledge set Ellen apart from any other career development support person I had ever encountered.
          <br><br>
          As time went on and I had occasion to speak directly with Ellen, I discovered a skill set even more valuable than her obvious combination of career-services-specific skill and knowledge: Ellen is genuinely invested in the success of the students she guides. …… Ellen displayed genuine investment in and understanding of my specific circumstances and needs--as I know she also did for any of my peers who reached out to her directly with questions or unique needs. ……. Ellen truly loves providing expert support to each individual on their specific path to professional success. The formal terms of her job description could not possibly capture the way that Ellen lights up at the opportunity to support, guide, and encourage the students under her direction. She has been indispensable to my success.
