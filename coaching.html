          <!-- ADHD & Executive Function -->
          <h2 id="executive-function">ADHD & Executive Function Coaching</h2>
          <p>Executive function coaching is a type of coaching that addresses a set of cognitive skills know as executive functions, which are essential for managing thoughts, actions and emotions to achieve goals. It is a practical, forward-thinking approach using concrete and actionable strategies to work with how your brain works. ADHD is the most common reason people seek this kind of coaching, but those without an ADHD diagnosis can also have difficulty with executive function skills.</p>
          <p>In executive function coaching, we work on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Planning and goal setting</li>

          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Reviewing last week’s progress and challenges, and offering tweaks;</li>
            <li>Planning for the upcoming week, with accountability checks and balances in place as needed;</li>
            <li>Problem solving specific issues, whether they are interpersonal, self-regulating, or academic;</li>

          <!-- The Coaching Process -->
          <h2 id="process">The Coaching Process</h2>

          <p><strong>What coaching is:</strong></p>
          <p>Coaching is a partnership between coach and client. The focus is on helping individuals achieve specific goals to reach their full personal and or professional potential. 
          It is goal oriented, focused on potential and individualized. Coaches provide ongoing support, feedback and guidance to move clients forward to their goals.
          Coaches use active listening, powerful questioning and objective observation to reframe challenges into potential successes.</p>

          <p><strong>What coaching isn’t:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Coaching is not counseling/therapy, consultancy, training, or a quick fix.</li>
            <li>Coaching isn’t for everyone, so let’s talk about if it’s right for you.</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Coaching may be right for you if:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>You know you can accomplish tasks well, but you don’t know how to, or where to start.</li>
            <li>Frustrated, ovewhelmed or feel like you are all over the place, but nothing gets completed.</li>
            <li>You are ready to move forward. </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Coaching may not be right for you if:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Someone else told you to get a coach. </li>
            <li>You would be better served with a tutor or a therapist.</li>
            <li>You want a magic and fast fix; coaching and results take time and commitment. </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>The coaching process:</strong></p>
          <p>The coaching process is a structured, collaborative method where a coach helps a client identify goals, explore options, and deliver action plans to move toward achieving desired outcomes.
          We will meet on Zoom, generally for 30-minute, 45-minute or hour-long sessions. 
          Our first session will be an hour-long session to get to know each other, discuss goals, and introduce some topics to get started.</p>
