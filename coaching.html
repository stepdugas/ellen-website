          <h2 id="executive-function">ADHD & Executive Function Coaching</h2>
          <p>Executive function coaching is a type of coaching that addresses a set of cognitive skills known as executive functions, which are essential for managing thoughts, actions and emotions to achieve goals. It is a practical, forward-thinking approach using concrete and actionable strategies to work with how your brain works.</p>
          <p>ADHD is the most common reason people seek this kind of coaching, but those without an ADHD diagnosis can also have difficulty with executive function skills.</p>
          <p>In executive function coaching, we work on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Planning and goal setting</li>
            <li>Prioritization</li>
            <li>Organization</li>
            <li>Time management</li>
            <li>Task initiation</li>
            <li>Accountability</li>
            <li>Implementing habits</li>
            <li>Working with your innate creative problem solving abilities</li>
            <li>And really anything else that would be helpful to the individual</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="productivity">Productivity Coaching</h2>
          <p>Productivity coaching helps you take control of your time, energy, and attention to get more done and feel less overwhelmed. We build habits, systems, and structures that match your working style and support your goals.</p>

          <h2 id="student-success">Student Success Coaching</h2>
          <p>Many students struggle with staying organized, planning ahead, and completing tasks independently.</p>
          <p>If you are a student or parent of a student who misses deadlines, cannot focus for long periods of time, has a tough time with confidence and self-esteem, and feels overwhelmed with too many tasks at once, coaching can help!</p>
          <p>Student coaching is action-oriented to promote student success. We work on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Building executive function skills with an individualized learning plan</li>
            <li>Time Management, Organization, Prioritization, Motivation, and Accountability</li>
            <li>Celebrating wins</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Sessions look like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reviewing progress and challenges from the previous week</li>
            <li>Planning upcoming weeks with accountability in place</li>
            <li>Problem solving specific issues (interpersonal, self-regulating, or academic)</li>
            <li>Learning and practicing a new skill</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="career-coaching">Career Coaching</h2>
          <p>I have spent more than 6 years coaching in early career and career transition, with a proven track record of success!</p>
          <p>We will work on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Transitioning from student to professional</li>
            <li>Resumes</li>
            <li>LinkedIn and other social media</li>
            <li>All types of interviewing</li>
            <li>Networking</li>
            <li>The job search</li>
            <li>Professionalism in the workplace</li>
            <li>And anything else you’d like!</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="process">The Coaching Process</h2>
          <p><strong>What coaching is:</strong></p>
          <p>Coaching is a partnership between coach and client. The focus is on helping individuals achieve specific goals to reach their full personal and/or professional potential.</p>
          <p>It is goal-oriented, focused on potential, and individualized. Coaches provide ongoing support, feedback, and guidance to move clients forward to their goals. Coaches use active listening, powerful questioning, and objective observation to reframe challenges into potential successes.</p>

          <p><strong>What coaching isn’t:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>It is not therapy, consulting, training, or a quick fix</li>
            <li>It isn’t for everyone — let’s talk about if it’s right for you</li>
            <li>It may not be right for you if someone else told you to get a coach, or you’re looking for a fast fix</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>The process:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>We meet on Zoom, generally for 30, 45, or 60-minute sessions</li>
            <li>The first session is a 60-minute intake to get to know each other and your goals</li>
            <li>Each session will include a review, planning, skill-building, and support</li>
          </ul>
