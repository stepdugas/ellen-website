      <p>Productivity Coaching is right for anyone who wants to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make the most of limited time and energy</li>
        <li>Build routines and habits that align with their goals</li>
        <li>Develop clarity about what to focus on and what to let go of</li>
        <li>Learn practical tools for managing workflow</li>
        <li>Feel a sense of accomplishment</li>
      </ul>

      <p>People with and without ADHD benefit from this type of support. Productivity coaching is about creating change and implementing strategies—not just talking about what’s hard. Together, we’ll explore what you want to shift, identify small steps to help you build momentum, and experiment with new systems until you find what works for you.</p>
