    <h1>Costs</h1>
    <p>Most clients meet with me every other week, and we can adjust that schedule based on your needs.</p>

    <p>Each coaching session is 45 minutes and costs <strong>$110</strong>.</p>

    <p>I reserve a few <strong>sliding scale</strong> spots for clients who need financial support. If this applies to you, please reach out — I'm happy to talk about options.</p>

    <p>You’ll never be locked into a long-term contract. We’ll check in regularly to make sure the coaching relationship is working for you.</p>
